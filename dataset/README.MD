# Introduction

The original dataset, that can be downloaded from here [link](https://www.physionet.org/content/sleep-accel/1.0.0/), comes with the different types of data separated in different locations and in `.txt` format. In order to fulfil the requirements for this TinyML project, it is necessary to conflate this data together. This also helps to convert it to a `.csv` format which is more manageable. Moreover, while putting together the data, some pre-processing is also carried out so as to generate a structure and a ready-to-use dataset.
