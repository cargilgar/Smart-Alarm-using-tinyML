For this project, we have decided to use the Multilevel Monitoring of Activity and Sleep in Healthy People dataset, or MMASH for short.

The original dataset can be found at [  Physionet.org - Multilevel Monitoring of Activity and Sleep in Healthy People  ](https://physionet.org/content/mmash/1.0.0/).
