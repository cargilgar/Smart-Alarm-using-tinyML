## Steps


## Running the program on Colab

Upload `tflite_model_training_DNN.ipynb` to your Google Drive and open it from the web-browser within the Google Drive page. 

Once you've opened the file, to generate your custom dataset out of the original one, simply run all the cells in this Colab. You do this by clicking the `run all` option in the Runtime tab or pressing `Ctrl+F9`.


## Running the program on Colab

To run the program locally in a Jupyter Notebook, you need to connect Google Colab to a Local Jupyter Runtime. To do this, please go to this [tutorial](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/local-runtimes.html "Google Colaboratory") which explains thoroughly how to set it up. 

Once that's done, just click `run all` under the `Cell` tab.
